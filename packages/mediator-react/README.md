# @oafz/mediator-react

It is based on `@oafz/mediator`.

There is a [demo](https://github.com/Xuhv/OAFZ.Mediator/tree/main/packages/react-demo) in the monorepo.

## NOTE âš 

I only publish the source code which written in typescript. My tsconfig.json is [here](https://github.com/Xuhv/OAFZ.Mediator/blob/main/tsconfig.json).
